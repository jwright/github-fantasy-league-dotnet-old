Feature: Display total score
	As an unauthorized user
	I should be able to view the total score for a Github user
	In order to compare Github users

    Scenario: Entering a valid Github username
      Given I have a valid github username
      And I am on the home page
      When I enter the Github username
      Then I should see the total score
